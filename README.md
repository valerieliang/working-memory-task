# Working Memory Task

This experiment evaluates your visual working memory by gauging how accurately you can recall a visual stimulus you just saw for a short period of time.

Be sure to update the condition files to have the correct pathway when running the experiment.

### Remember and know paradigm:
According to this theory, an individual makes a "remember" response when recollection has occurred. A know response is made when recollection has not occurred, and the individual must decide whether they recognize the target item solely on familiarity.

### Possible Experimental Confounds:
People with poor color recognition may perform worse by selecting an off-color as a response, even if they remember accurately what the color is.
